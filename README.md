<h1>LingoKnight Project</h1>
<h3>Project Details</h3>
<p>
As a "Mobiles Solutions" major student I was tasked with learning Kotlin and new Android techniques. The accumulation of this learning was a individual project to create a word quiz application that would assist in the translation and learning of a new language. I had a strong focus on my target users, young children. Thus I designed and built a user experience to match this user group using Adobe xD and Illustrator. Technical skills used included using the MVVM pattern, Rooms database, LiveData and downloading and converting Json data using Moshi.

<h3>Self-Evaluation of Project</h3>    
<p>
Lingo Knight was my second Android project, this time using Kotlin as the language. This was a very different process when compare to my first project using Java, this time I was utilising more standard Android architect features that were new to me. The implementation of the MVVM pattern utilizing LivaData started out to be quite tricky until an insightful session with my course lecturer helped clear up where I was going wrong. This allowed me to progress and build a fully modular application that allowed for changes on the UI during orientation changes without loosing data.   
</p>
<p>
Even though the project has been well received by my course teachers, due to time restrictions my initial design was not fully realised.
\n Therefore the project will be updated as and when these are worked on.
